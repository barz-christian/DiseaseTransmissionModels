$\begin{aligned}\frac{S}{dt} = & -\beta S \frac{I}{N} \\ \frac{dI}{dt} = & \beta S\frac{I}{N} - \gamma I \\ \frac{dR}{dt} = & \gamma I \end{aligned}$


where :

- $S(t)$ is the number of people susceptible to becoming infected (no immunity),
- $I(t)$ is the number of people currently infected (and infectious),
- $R(t)$ is the number of recovered people (we assume they remain immune indefinitely),
- $N$ is the total number of the population,
- $\beta$ is the constant rate of infectious contact between people,
- $\gamma$ the constant recovery rate of infected individuals.
