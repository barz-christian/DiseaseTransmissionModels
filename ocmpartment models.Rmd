# Summary

In this note I want to collect a discription of different [compartment models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-compartment_model). In a compartment model the population is splited into 'disjoint' subset, called *compartments*, and the transition between the compartments is described by a system of differential equations.
